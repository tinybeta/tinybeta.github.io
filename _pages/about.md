ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Division of Decision and Control SystemsÂ under the supervision of ProfessorsÂ [Karl Henrik Johansson](people.kth.se/~kallej/)Â and [Angela Fontan](angelafontan.github.io/).
I received my PhD in Control Theory and Control Engineering from Xidian University in 2021, advised by ProfessorÂ Long Wang.Â From 2017 to 2019, I was a visiting student at the University of California, Santa Barbara, working with Professors Francesco BulloÂ andÂ Noah E. Friedkin. Between 2021 and 2025, I held research positions at Peking University, Kyoto University, and Nanyang Technological University.

My research focuses on dyanmical network systems, with application in social networks.

My research focuses on **networked systems**, including opinion dyanmics, multi-agent systems and collective intelligence.
