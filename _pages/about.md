ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Division of Decision and Control Systems, KTH Royal Institue of TechnologyÂ under the supervision of ProfessorsÂ [Karl Henrik Johansson](https://people.kth.se/~kallej/)Â and [Angela Fontan](https://angelafontan.github.io/).

I received my PhD in Control Theory and Control Engineering from Xidian University in 2021, advised by ProfessorÂ [Long Wang](https://www.ai.pku.edu.cn/en/info/1406/1812.htm).Â From 2017 to 2019, I was a visiting student at the University of California, Santa Barbara, working with Professors [Francesco Bullo](https://fbullo.github.io/)Â andÂ [Noah E. Friedkin](https://www.soc.ucsb.edu/people/noah-friedkin). Between 2021 and 2025, I held research positions at Peking University, Kyoto University, and Nanyang Technological University.


My research focuses on **dynamical network systems**, with applications in social networks and collective behaviors.
